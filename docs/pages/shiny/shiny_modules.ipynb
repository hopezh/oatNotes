        "\n",
        "> Modules solve these problems by ***encapsulating*** both the `UI` and\n",
        "> `server` logic in their own `namespace`.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> A `module namespace` can be thought of as a ***container*** for a\n",
        "> module’s code, and helps to keep the module’s `variables`,\n",
        "> `functions`, and `classes` separate from those in other modules.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> This separation prevents naming conflicts and makes the code easier to\n",
        "> understand and manage.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> A `namespace` is a unique ***identifier*** that Shiny assigns to each\n",
        "> instance of a module to keep its `input` and `output` IDs separate\n",
        "> from the IDs of other instances and from the rest of the Shiny\n",

        "# How to use modules\n",
        "\n",
        "## Create modules\n",
        "\n",
        "> At their core, `modules` are just `functions` and so anything you can\n",
        "> do with a function you can also do with a module.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Modules can take any `argument`, and can `return` any value to the\n",
        "> caller.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Modules usually include both `UI` and `server` elements which work\n",
        "> together to encapsulate a part of your application, and the module UI\n",
        "> and server work exactly the same way they do in a regular Shiny\n",
        "> application.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The UI part of the module is a function which returns UI elements, and\n",
        "> is decorated with the `@module.ui` decorator.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> This decorator sets a default `module namespace`, so each component\n",
        "> created by the function has a prefix implicitly added to its ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "``` python\n",

        "> The module server function looks just like a Shiny app server\n",

        "\n",
        "> To use this module in an application, you call the module UI and\n",
        "> server functions inside of the application UI and server functions.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Every module call includes an id argument which defines the module’s\n",
        "> `namespace.` This id has two requirements.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> -   First, it must be ***unique*** in a single scope, and can’t be\n",
        ">     duplicated in a given application or module definition. If you\n",
        ">     need to generate many instances of a single module, it is often a\n",
        ">     good idea to store their ids in a list, and use\n",
        ">     `list comprehension` to generate the UI and server instances.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> -   Second, the UI and server ids must match. This ensures that the UI\n",
        ">     and server instances exist in the same namespace, and if the ids\n",
        ">     don’t match, the UI and server modules will not be able to\n",
