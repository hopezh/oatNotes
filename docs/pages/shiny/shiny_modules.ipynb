        "> `server` logic in their own `namespace`.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> A `module namespace` can be thought of as a ***container*** for a\n",

        "> `functions`, and `classes` separate from those in other modules.\n",

        ">\n",
        "> A `namespace` is a unique ***identifier*** that Shiny assigns to each\n",

        "## Create modules\n",
        "\n",
        "> At their core, `modules` are just `functions` and so anything you can\n",
        "> do with a function you can also do with a module.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Modules can take any `argument`, and can `return` any value to the\n",
        "> caller.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Modules usually include both `UI` and `server` elements which work\n",
        "> together to encapsulate a part of your application, and the module UI\n",
        "> and server work exactly the same way they do in a regular Shiny\n",
        "> application.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The UI part of the module is a function which returns UI elements, and\n",
        "> is decorated with the `@module.ui` decorator.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> This decorator sets a default `module namespace`, so each component\n",
        "> created by the function has a prefix implicitly added to its ID.\n",

        ">\n",
        "> Every module call includes an id argument which defines the module’s\n",
        "> `namespace.` This id has two requirements.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> -   First, it must be ***unique*** in a single scope, and can’t be\n",
        ">     duplicated in a given application or module definition. If you\n",
        ">     need to generate many instances of a single module, it is often a\n",

        ">\n",
        "> -   Second, the UI and server ids must match. This ensures that the UI\n",
        ">     and server instances exist in the same namespace, and if the ids\n",
        ">     don’t match, the UI and server modules will not be able to\n",
